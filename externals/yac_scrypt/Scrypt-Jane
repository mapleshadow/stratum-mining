#Description
Stratum-mining is a pooled mining protocol. It is a replacement for *getwork* based pooling servers by allowing clients to generate work. The stratum protocol is described [here](http://mining.bitcoin.cz/stratum-mining) in full detail.

This is a implementation of stratum-mining for Scrypt-Jane based coins. It is compatible with *mmcfe-ng* as well as *mmcfe*, as it complies with the standards of *pushpool*. T

The goal is to make a reliable stratum mining server for scrypt-jane based coins. 


Install Scrypt-Jane.

Inside the yac_scrypt folder is a file named scryptmodule.c.

In lines 10-13 set the scrypt-jane parameters for the coin you want to use stratum for.

Below is an example for Gold Pressed Latinum:

const unsigned char minNfactor = 4;
const unsigned char maxNfactor = 30;
int nChainStartTime = 1377557832;

After setting the parameters, you install scrypt-jane with the folling command:

sudo python setup.py install

Next, open the config.py.example file in the conf folder.

Set the parameters to you needs.

Note: The coinbase address is the full pubkey. Simply get an address from the daemon. Example (./goldpressedlatinumd getnewaddress pool)

take the address given and use the validate function to get the full pub key example(./goldpressedlatinumd validateaddress <address you received in first step>)

One of the values listed will be the full pubkey.

save the file as config.py

Read through the install instructions to make sure all dependencies are installed.

Start stratum with:

twistd -ny launcher.tac -l -
